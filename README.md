# JS-Canvas-Wrapper
WIP. A simple to use object oriented garphics library using the Canvas API to allow you to create browser based games easier. It provides the functionality of the Canvas API in the form of objects and classes for a more beginner friendly approach to game development.

It still needs a lot of work but currently contains the basics needed to create simple 2d games/graphics. You can check out the examples folder to see some simple demos.

Uses https://github.com/davidfig/intersects library for most of the intersection code. All code and license information can be found in the intersects directory
