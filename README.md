# JS-Canvas-Wrapper
WIP. A simple to use object oriented library using the Canvas API to allow you to create browser based games easier. It provides the functionality of the Canvas API in the form of objects and classes.

It still needs a lot of work but currently contains the basic needed to create simple 2d games/graphics. You can check out the examples folder to see some simple demos.
